## RECORDED TIME:

- Starting this project on 6/30/25 @ 8:40pm

- 8:40pm - start / Create nextjs app
- 8:44pm - create components (main container, search bar, upload button, image grid)
- 9:19pm - Break
- 9:29pm - Continue logic / review TS syntax errors
- 10:40pm - Stop, upload to github, send to Bonnie Gibbs
- 10:50pm - Update ReadMe and push to Github

## OUTSTANDING ITEMS:

- I wasn't able to get to the CRUD portion of the project. I recognize that I need a GET, POST, and DELETE request for the images. My intent was to mock the api so that I could save time on the setup of storage.
- The DELETE logic would have gone in the UploadedImages.tsx file.
- The GET logic would have gone in the page.tsx file
- The POST logic would have gone in the FileUploader.tsx

## ACTION ITEMS

- Given the timeline/circumstances of my move to Austin, and as I started this project on 6/30/25 and have 48 hours to complete it, I will update Bonnie on my progress and will see if it is okay to finish this tomorrow.

ABOUT NEXT JS

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
